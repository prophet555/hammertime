Just spent the last two days, about 5 hours learning neovim.  It's like trying to fly a plane, which is a terrible analogy since I never ever tried to well, fly a plane.

Why put myself through the toture of learning a note taking app 10x harder than obsidian?  Well I enjoy learning hard things.

Some of the shortcuts that I learnt, to add to all the shortcuts learnt for every other app.
