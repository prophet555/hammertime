Taught my 10 year old and 8 year old sons to setup git.  Oldest son, managed to get the astro template working locally but had some struggles getting the ssh key to connect with his git.  After the edits we were stuck at git push origin.

Worked on cursor IDE, and it blows vscode + copilot out of the water for debugging the basics of terminal, git, and working with astro templates.

Getting this file up and running using the obsidian sync feature and using it as a workflow to update blog more often.
