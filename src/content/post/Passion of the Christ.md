Watched it for the first time this Easter weekend.

Finding the accuracy of the retelling of the scriptures to be refreshing. I realised why the movie has made an impact to the christians and non-christians alike, the grueling scenes were of the abandonment, mockery and flesh Jesus had to suffer at the hands of rulers and his own priests. I understand why some think it’s anti semitic but it’s more of a harsh judgement against crowd psychology.

The final 60 seconds of the movie, inside the tomb and the close up shot of his pierced hands into his face was a great ending scene, one of the classic ending scenes of all time.
