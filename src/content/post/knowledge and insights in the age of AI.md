The new wave of searching for information has changed the way knowledge workers will operate.  With AI able to summarize books chapter by chapter, classics will be harder to read and the advantage will go to those who can go deep into the text word by word and truly understand the intentions of the authors of the past and apply them to the world at large. A key usage of slower digesting of information will be text to audio application : Using the local audio formats to read information is painful in the inhumanlike sound, and the inability to bypass linksin the audio.

Application of definitions as you read, or a log where you can log paragraphs and words quickly as you read will also be missional critical tool as people go deeper into past works.

Knowledge graphs will also be more complex as we already have applications inside obsidian making 'smart connections' and wiki like rabbit holes.  Creating tags, folders and links are a manual process, and we are likely to have AI applications that will do this intelligently and adapt to our current requirements and search queries.
